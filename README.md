# Parking Lot Design

## Intoduction
This assignment is completed in accordance to the assignment given by ODE Holdings. The parking Lot design is implemented using a linear parking lot with different parking spots for motocycles, cars and vans. Certain assumptions were taken in regards to the instructions given in the email, a motorcycle can be parked in a motorcyle spot or a car spot or a van spot. Priority is given in the order of motorcycle, car and van spots. Similarly cars can be parked in car spot or van spot. Priority is given to an empty car spot and then an empty van spot. Vans can be parked in a van spot or in 3 adjacent car spots. Priority is given to an empty van spot and then to 3 adjacent car spots.

## Time taken
The basic packages, classes and methods were written within one hour. Some extra time was taken to refine the parking function to include some more business logic apart from the assumptions in the email. 

## Upcoming modifications
Adding exception classes and handling them. Making a 2D parking lot with different floors, and ticket counters with timers etc.
